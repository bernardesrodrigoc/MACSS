## MACSS: machine learning applied to chemometric spectral analysis

Author: Dr. Rodrigo Cupertino Bernardes [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-cupertino-bernardes/)

## Overview
This platform is associated with the scientific study titled "AI-driven detection of pesticide contamination in bees using reflectance profiling." The study explores the application of hyperspectral reflectance data and machine learning models to identify pesticide contamination in bee carcasses.

The dataset used in this study is available on the Zenodo platform: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11643453](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11643453)

## Running the Application
### To run the application locally:

Make sure you have R installed on your machine.
Execute the script run_macss_app.R.
The application will open in your default web browser.
#### System Requirements
R version 4.4.0 or higher is recommended.
### Web Application
The application is also available online as a web app at [https://macsstat.shinyapps.io/macss/](https://macsstat.shinyapps.io/macss/). However, running it locally is recommended due to the heavy computational load of the AI models, which may cause disconnections on the web server due to insufficient RAM.

## Instructions
### Local Installation:

Open R
Run the script run_macss_app.R.
The application will automatically open in your default web browser.
